# Thinkful - Data Structures & Algorithms

## Working with Arrays

The exercises here rely on the memory module provided in the curriculum. This is an array to simulate a block of memory. This is simply a learning tool and spotty at best.

The various files in this exercise:

- `memory.js` -> mock memory established to practice with arrays
- `array.js` -> An array class
- `main.js` -> this file contains all of the drills completed in this module.

It should be noted that console logs all over the code. In this case, those console logs are to assist learning the material.

In the `main.js` file all of the exercise functions are called at the end. They have been commented out in order to clear up the console. If you are using this to learn the material it is useful to uncomment those calls and see what is printed to the console.

## Drills

Environment -> https://thorn51.github.io/DSA-Arrays/

The environment goes over the construction of the array class. It then has a series of drills that were attempted in this module.

If the drills don't have answers then they are incomplete and are still in the process of being worked on.
